L2 nodes derive the L2 chain from the L1 by reading transactions commitments from this sequencer inbox.\n        When reading from the inbox, the op-node verifies that the commitment hash is a valid IPFS CID. If the data corresponding to the hash is missing from IPFS, the op-node will halt, preventing further derivation of the L2 chain. \n    ","references":[{"text":"FraxtalDA Documentation","href":"https://docs.frax.com/fraxtal/network/data-availability"},{"text":"Fraxtal DA Follower - Source Code","href":"https://github.com/FraxFinance/fraxtal-da-follower/blob/791e849b41465e1e00377f57c8f0c49d4b13caa8/main.go"}],"risks":[{"category":"Funds can be lost if","text":"the sequencer posts an invalid data availability commitment."}]},"bridges":[{"id":"fraxtalDABridge","createdAt":1723022143,"type":"NoBridge","display":{"name":"No Bridge","slug":"da","description":"The SequencerInbox only stores IPFS hash commitments posted by the sequencer.
