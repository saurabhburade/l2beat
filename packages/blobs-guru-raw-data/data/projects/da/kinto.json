Since each challenge lasts 6d 8h, this implies that the protocol can be subject to [delay attacks](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/solutions-to-delay-attacks-on-rollups-434f9d05a07a), where a malicious actor can delay withdrawals as long as they are willing to pay the cost of losing their stakes. If the protocol is delayed attacked, the new stake requirement increases exponentially for each challenge period of delay. Challenges are played via a bisection game, where asserter and challenger play together to find the first instruction of disagreement. Such instruction is then executed onchain in the WASM OneStepProver contract to determine the winner, who then gets half of the stake of the loser. As said before, a state root is rejected only when no one left is staked on it. The protocol does not enforces valid bisections, meaning that actors can propose correct initial claim and then provide incorrect midpoints.","references":[{"text":"Fraud Proof Wars: Arbitrum Classic","href":"https://medium.com/l2beat/fraud-proof-wars-b0cb4d0f452a"}]}]},"milestones":[{"name":"Security Council Governance","link":"https://docs.kinto.xyz/kinto-the-safe-l2/security-kyc-aml/security-council","date":"2024-11-03T00:00:00Z","description":"Kinto gives the ownership of all L1 system contracts to a Security Council that is properly set up.","type":"general"},{"name":"First ever Challenge on mainnet","link":"https://x.com/vincfurc/status/1853891918037463521","date":"2024-10-31T00:00:00Z","description":"The first correctly resolved fault proof challenge of a mainnet Orbit stack rollup.","type":"general"},{"name":"Mainnet full launch","link":"https://medium.com/mamori-finance/%EF%B8%8F-engen-is-over-kinto-is-launching-d9f2dd49fb2e","date":"2024-05-22T00:00:00Z","description":"Engen mining is completed and locked funds are bridged to the Kinto L2.","type":"general"},{"name":"Kinto Mainnet Genesis","link":"https://medium.com/mamori-finance/%EF%B8%8F-kintos-launch-the-set-up-7eddfbb4bc38","date":"2023-12-15T00:00:00Z","description":"Kinto mainnet is launched.
