Since each challenge lasts 6d, this implies that the protocol can be subject to [delay attacks](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/solutions-to-delay-attacks-on-rollups-434f9d05a07a), where a malicious actor can delay withdrawals as long as they are willing to pay the cost of losing their stakes. If the protocol is delayed attacked, the new stake requirement increases exponentially for each challenge period of delay. Challenges are played via a bisection game, where asserter and challenger play together to find the first instruction of disagreement. Such instruction is then executed onchain in the WASM OneStepProver contract to determine the winner, who then gets half of the stake of the loser. As said before, a state root is rejected only when no one left is staked on it. The protocol does not enforces valid bisections, meaning that actors can propose correct initial claim and then provide incorrect midpoints.","references":[{"text":"Fraud Proof Wars: Arbitrum Classic","href":"https://medium.com/l2beat/fraud-proof-wars-b0cb4d0f452a"}]}]},"milestones":[{"name":"ArbOS v20 upgrade","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-arbos-version-20-atlas/20957","date":"2024-04-10T00:00:00.00Z","description":"Introduces EIP-4844 data blobs for L1 data availability and Dencun-related opcodes on L2.","type":"general"},{"name":"Parallel Mainnet closed launch","link":"https://twitter.com/ParallelFi/status/1743048283684237574","date":"2024-01-05T00:00:00Z","description":"Parallel Mainnet is open for developers.","type":"general"}],"badges":["Orbit","EthereumCalldata","EVM"],"discoveryDrivenData":true,"display":{"architectureImage":"orbit-rollup","stateValidationImage":"orbit","purposes":["Universal"],"warning":"Fraud proof system is fully deployed but is not yet permissionless as it requires Validators to be whitelisted.","reasonsForBeingOther":[{"label":"No proofs","shortDescription":"The proof system isn't fully functional","description":"Projects without a proper proof system fully rely on single entities to safely update the state.
