New nodes cannot be created faster than the minimum assertion period by the same validator, currently set to 15m.

Since each challenge lasts 6d 8h, this implies that the protocol can be subject to [delay attacks](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/solutions-to-delay-attacks-on-rollups-434f9d05a07a), where a malicious actor can delay withdrawals as long as they are willing to pay the cost of losing their stakes. If the protocol is delayed attacked, the new stake requirement increases exponentially for each challenge period of delay. Challenges are played via a bisection game, where asserter and challenger play together to find the first instruction of disagreement. Such instruction is then executed onchain in the WASM OneStepProver contract to determine the winner, who then gets half of the stake of the loser. As said before, a state root is rejected only when no one left is staked on it. The protocol does not enforces valid bisections, meaning that actors can propose correct initial claim and then provide incorrect midpoints.","references":[{"title":"Fraud Proof Wars: Arbitrum Classic","url":"https://medium.com/l2beat/fraud-proof-wars-b0cb4d0f452a"}]}]},"milestones":[],"badges":[{"id":"Caldera","type":"RaaS","name":"Caldera","description":"This project was deployed via the rollup-as-a-service provider Caldera","action":{"type":"scalingFilter","id":"raas","value":"Caldera"}},{"id":"Orbit","type":"Stack","name":"Built on Arbitrum Orbit","description":"The project is built on Arbitrum Orbit","action":{"type":"scalingFilter","id":"stack","value":"Arbitrum"}},{"id":"DAC","type":"DA","name":"Data Availability Committee","description":"There is a Data Availability Committee that provides/attests to data availability","action":{"type":"selfDaHighlight"}},{"id":"EVM","type":"VM","name":"EVM","description":"This project uses the Ethereum Virtual Machine to run its smart contracts and supports the Solidity programming language","action":{"type":"scalingFilter","id":"vm","value":"EVM"}},{"id":"EspressoPreconfs","type":"Other","name":"Espresso Preconfs","description":"The project integrates with Espresso preconfirmations.
