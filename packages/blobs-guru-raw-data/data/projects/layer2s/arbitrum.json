A state root can have multiple conflicting children. State roots are referred to as \"assertions\" within the contracts. Each chain of assertions only requires one stake, and validators staked on assertions with a child are considered inactive and can either move their stake to a new node or withdraw it. The function used to propose a new assertion is the `stakeOnNewAssertion` function. The stake is currently set to 3600.0 ETH, and it can be slashed if the proposal is proven incorrect via a fraud proof. The protocol allows such funds to be trustlessly pooled together if necessary. New nodes cannot be created faster than the minimum assertion period, currently set to 15m.

Edges represent assertions, or bisected assertions, within the challenge protocol. Challenges are played via a bisection game, where asserters and challengers play together to find the first instruction of disagreement. Such instruction is then executed onchain in the WASM OneStepProver contract to determine the winner. An edge can only be bisected when rivaled. The bisection process requires no new stake as their validity is checked against a parent \"history root\" that contains all intermediate states. An edge can also be confirmed if itself or its descendants spend enough time being unrivaled. Such time is set to 6d 8h. If both actors play as slow as possible, the maximum time to confirm an edge is double such value, i.e. 12d 17h. Due to the complexities of maintaining the history root, the challenge protocol is divided into 3 levels, where the lowest level represents assertions over blocks, the highest level represents assertions over single WASM instructions, and intermediate levels represent assertions over chunks of WASM instructions. When moving between levels, a new stake is required. Level 0 (block level) requires a stake of 0.0 ETH, level 1 requires a stake of 555.0 ETH, level 2 requires a stake of 79.0 ETH. The ratio between such stakes can be exploited to perform resource exhaustion attacks.","risks":[{"category":"Funds can be stolen if","text":"an attacker successfully performs a resource exhaustion

critical system smart contracts are upgradeable (can be arbitrarily changed). This permission is governed by the Arbitrum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)\nand their elected Security Council. The Arbitrum DAO controls Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova through upgrades and modifications to their smart contracts on Layer 1 Ethereum and the Layer 2s.\nWhile the DAO governs through token-weighted governance in their associated ARB token, the Security Council can directly act through\nmultisigs on all three chains. Although they are technically separate and connect to different target permissions,\ntheir member- and threshold configuration is kept in sync by a manager contract on Arbitrum One sending crosschain transactions.\n\nRegular upgrades, Admin- and Owner actions originate from either the Arbitrum DAO or the non-emergency (Proposer-) Security Council on Arbitrum One\nand pass through multiple delays and timelocks before being executed at their destination. Contrarily, the three Emergency Security Council multisigs\n(one on each chain: Arbitrum One, Ethereum, Arbitrum Nova) can skip delays and directly access all admin- and upgrade functions of all smart contracts.\nThese two general paths have the same destination: the respective UpgradeExecutor smart contract.\n\nRegular upgrades are scheduled in the L2 Timelock. The proposer Security Council can do this directly and the Arbitrum DAO (ARB token holders and delegates) must meet a\nCoreGovernor-enforced 4.5% threshold of the votable tokens. The L2 Timelock queues the transaction for a 8d delay and then sends it to the Outbox contract on Ethereum. This incurs another delay (the challenge period) of 6d 8h, which is extended by an additional 2d if the top-level assertion has been challenged.\nWhen that has passed, the L1 Timelock delays for additional 3d. Both timelocks serve as delays during which the transparent transaction contents can be audited,\nand, in the case of the final L1 timelock, cancelled by the Emergency Security Council. Finally, the transaction can be executed, calling Admin- or Owner restricted functions of the respective destination smart contracts\nthrough the UpgradeExecutor on Ethereum. If the predefined  transaction destination is Arbitrum One or -Nova, this last call is executed on L2 through the canonical bridge and the aliased address of the L1 Timelock.\n\nOperator roles like the Sequencers and Validators are managed using the same paths.\nSequencer changes can be delegated to a Batch Poster Manager role.\n\nTransactions targeting the Arbitrum DAO Treasury can be scheduled in the 3d\nTreasury Timelock by meeting a TreasuryGovernor-enforced 3% threshold of votable ARB tokens. The Security Council cannot regularly cancel\nthese transactions or schedule different ones but can overwrite them anyway by having upgrade permissions for all the underlying smart contracts."}
