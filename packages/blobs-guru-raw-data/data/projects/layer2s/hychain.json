If the protocol is delayed attacked, the new stake requirement increases exponentially for each challenge period of delay. Challenges are played via a bisection game, where asserter and challenger play together to find the first instruction of disagreement. Such instruction is then executed onchain in the WASM OneStepProver contract to determine the winner, who then gets half of the stake of the loser. As said before, a state root is rejected only when no one left is staked on it. The protocol does not enforces valid bisections, meaning that actors can propose correct initial claim and then provide incorrect midpoints.","references":[{"title":"Fraud Proof Wars: Arbitrum Classic","url":"https://medium.com/l2beat/fraud-proof-wars-b0cb4d0f452a"}]}]},"milestones":[{"title":"Mainnet Launch","url":"https://x.com/WINRProtocol/status/1867223130684735514","date":"2024-03-09T00:00:00Z","description":"HYCHAIN launches its Mainnet.","type":"general"}],"badges":[{"id":"Caldera","type":"RaaS","name":"Caldera","description":"This project was deployed via the rollup-as-a-service provider Caldera","action":{"type":"scalingFilter","id":"raas","value":"Caldera"}},{"id":"Orbit","type":"Stack","name":"Built on Arbitrum Orbit","description":"The project is built on Arbitrum Orbit","action":{"type":"scalingFilter","id":"stack","value":"Arbitrum"}},{"id":"DAC","type":"DA","name":"Data Availability Committee","description":"There is a Data Availability Committee that provides/attests to data availability","action":{"type":"selfDaHighlight"}},{"id":"EVM","type":"VM","name":"EVM","description":"This project uses the Ethereum Virtual Machine to run its smart contracts and supports the Solidity programming language","action":{"type":"scalingFilter","id":"vm","value":"EVM"}}],"customDa":{"type":"Data Availability Committee","description":"Set of parties responsible for signing and attesting to the availability of data.","dac":{"membersCount":1,"requiredMembers":1},"technology":{"description":"\n## Architecture\n![Anytrust architecture](/images/da-layer-technology/anytrust/architecture1.png#center)\n\nThe DAC uses a data availability solution built on the AnyTrust protocol. It is composed of the following components:\n- **Sequencer Inbox**: Main entry point for the Sequencer submitting transaction batches.\n- **Data Availability Committee (DAC)**: A group of members responsible for storing and providing data on demand.\n- **Data Availability Certificate (DACert)**: A commitment ensuring that data blobs are available without needing full data posting on the L1 chain. \n\n\nCommittee members run servers that support APIs for storing and retrieving data blobs. \nThe Sequencer API allows the rollup Sequencer to submit data blobs for storage, while the REST API enables anyone to fetch data by hash. \nWhen the Sequencer produces a data batch, it sends the batch along with an expiration time to Committee members, who store it and sign it. \nOnce enough signatures are collected, the Sequencer aggregates them into a valid DACert and posts it to the L1 chain inbox. \nIf the Sequencer fails to collect enough signatures, it falls back to posting the full data to the L1 chain. \n\n\nA DACert includes a hash of the data block, an expiration time, and proof that the required threshold of Committee members have signed off on the data. \nThe proof consists of a hash of the Keyset used in signing, a bitmap indicating which members signed, and a BLS aggregated signature. \nL2 nodes reading from the sequencer inbox verify the certificate’s validity by checking the number of signers, the aggregated signature, and that the expiration time is at least two weeks ahead of the L2 timestamp. \nIf the DACert is valid, it provides a proof that the corresponding data is available from honest committee members.\n\n## DA Bridge Architecture\n![Anytrust bridge architecture](/images/da-bridge-technology/anytrust/architectureL2.png#center)\n\nThe DA commitments are posted to the destination chain through the sequencer inbox, using the inbox as a DA bridge.\nThe DA commitment consists of Data Availability Certificate (DACert), including a hash of the data block, an expiration time, and a proof that the required threshold of Committee members have signed off on the data.\nThe sequencer distributes the data and collects signatures from Committee members offchain. Only the DACert is posted by the sequencer to the destination chain inbox (the DA bridge), achieving destination chain transaction ordering finality in a single onchain transaction.\n    ","risks":[{"category":"Funds can be lost if","text":"a malicious committee attests to an invalid data availability certificate."},{"category":"Funds can be lost if","text":"the bridge contract or its dependencies receive a malicious code upgrade.
