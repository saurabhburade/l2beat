Single round proofs (1R) prove the validity of a state proposal, only requiring a single transaction to resolve. A fault proof eliminates a state proposal by proving that any intermediate state transition in the proposal results in a different state root. For either, a ZK proof is used. Since the node source is not available, challengers cannot watch the chain independently.","sentiment":"bad","executionDelay":302400,"challengeDelay":604800,"initialBond":"0.00001","orderHint":null},"exitWindow":{"value":"None","description":"There is no window for users to exit in case of an unwanted regular upgrade since contracts are instantly upgradable.","sentiment":"bad","orderHint":-604800},"proposerFailure":{"value":"Cannot withdraw","description":"Only the whitelisted proposers can publish state roots on L1, so in the event of failure the withdrawals are frozen.","sentiment":"bad","orderHint":null},"dataAvailability":{"value":"External","description":"Proof construction and state derivation fully rely on data that is posted on EigenDA.
