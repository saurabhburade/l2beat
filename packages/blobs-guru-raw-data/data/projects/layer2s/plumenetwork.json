A state root can have multiple conflicting children. This structure forms a graph, and therefore, in the contracts, state roots are referred to as nodes. Each proposal requires a stake, currently set to 0.1 ETH, that can be slashed if the proposal is proven incorrect via a fraud proof. Stakes can be moved from one node to one of its children, either by calling `stakeOnExistingNode` or `stakeOnNewNode`. New nodes cannot be created faster than the minimum assertion period by the same validator, currently set to 15m.

Validators cannot be in more than one challenge at the same time, meaning that the protocol operates with [partial concurrency](https://medium.com/l2beat/fraud-proof-wars-b0cb4d0f452a). Since each challenge lasts 5d 14h, this implies that the protocol can be subject to [delay attacks](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/solutions-to-delay-attacks-on-rollups-434f9d05a07a), where a malicious actor can delay withdrawals as long as they are willing to pay the cost of losing their stakes. If the protocol is delayed attacked, the new stake requirement increases exponentially for each challenge period of delay. Challenges are played via a bisection game, where asserter and challenger play together to find the first instruction of disagreement. Such instruction is then executed onchain in the WASM OneStepProver contract to determine the winner, who then gets half of the stake of the loser. As said before, a state root is rejected only when no one left is staked on it. The protocol does not enforces valid bisections, meaning that actors can propose correct initial claim and then provide incorrect midpoints.","references":[{"title":"Fraud Proof Wars: Arbitrum Classic","url":"https://medium.com/l2beat/fraud-proof-wars-b0cb4d0f452a"}]}]},"milestones":[],"badges":[{"id":"Conduit","type":"RaaS","name":"Conduit","description":"This project was deployed via the rollup-as-a-service provider Conduit","action":{"type":"scalingFilter","id":"raas","value":"Conduit"}},{"id":"Orbit","type":"Stack","name":"Built on Arbitrum Orbit","description":"The project is built on Arbitrum Orbit","action":{"type":"scalingFilter","id":"stack","value":"Arbitrum"}},{"id":"CelestiaBlobstream","type":"DA","name":"Celestia with Blobstream","description":"This project utilizes Celestia and has Blobstream enabled, facilitating the bridging of data availability commitments between Celestia and Ethereum.","action":{"type":"publicDaHighlight","slug":"celestia"}},{"id":"EVM","type":"VM","name":"EVM","description":"This project uses the Ethereum Virtual Machine to run its smart contracts and supports the Solidity programming language","action":{"type":"scalingFilter","id":"vm","value":"EVM"}}],"reasonsForBeingOther":[{"label":"Closed proofs","shortDescription":"There are less than 5 external actors that can submit challenges","description":"Projects without a sufficiently decentralized set of challengers rely on few entities to safely update the state.
