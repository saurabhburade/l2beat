`ScrollOwner` contract. The ScrollOwner is a central governance contract controlled by four distinct Timelocks: two governed by the Security Council multisig and two by the Scroll team multisigs. Each multisig can initiate specific types of changes with differing delay guarantees. The team has authority to revert unfinalized batches and add or remove sequencers and provers while sequencing is in permissioned mode. As the ScrollOwner admin, the Security Council can revert the team actions by revoking the team roles in the ScrollOwner contract (through the `TimelockSCSlow`) and upgrading the affected contracts. The Security Council can change parameters that affect L1->L2 messaging and the activation of permissionless sequencing (i.e., enforcedBatchMode), such as by calling the `updateMessageQueueParameters` and `updateEnforcedBatchParameters` functions or by pausing the `EnforcedTXGateway`. Emergency pause of core contracts is managed through the `PauseController`, which allows the team to pause batch commitment and finalization in permissioned mode, as well as L1->L2 messaging. Each pause is subject to a cooldown period of 30d execution delay, during which the Security Council minority can unpause, while the Security Council majority is authorized to update and reset the cooldown period. SCR token holders perform onchain voting on governance proposals through the `AgoraGovernor` contract on L2. However, onchain governance proposals do not contain transaction payloads, so onchain voting only acts as an onchain temperature check. The Security Council is in charge of executing upgrades.","milestones":[{"title":"Scroll Feynman upgrade","url":"https://forum.scroll.io/t/proposal-feynman-upgrade/957","date":"2025-08-18T00:00:00Z","description":"Feynman upgrade to improve the fee model and EVM compatibility.","type":"general"},{"title":"Emergency verifier upgrade","url":"https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3367e24b6cb138cea321f4556259660f24aba1b79ccce8f798ed135e28905f17","date":"2025-08-09T00:00:00Z","description":"The SecurityCouncil emergency upgrades to fix a bug in the verifier.","type":"incident"},{"title":"Access control upgrade","url":"https://etherscan.io/tx/0x13c8a293bc6a367eb2510a2bd71cacefbe9705588a574696e790db820b3f520d","date":"2025-08-01T00:00:00Z","description":"Scroll Security Council upgrades permissions to regain Stage 1 status.","type":"general"},{"title":"Emergency upgrade","url":"https://forum.scroll.io/t/security-council-report-scroll-mainnet-emergency-upgrade-on-2025-05-26/810","date":"2025-05-26T00:00:00Z","description":"The SecurityCouncil emergency upgrades to fix a bug in the plonky3-based proof system.","type":"incident"},{"title":"Scroll Euclid upgrade","url":"https://scroll.io/blog/euclid-upgrade","date":"2025-04-24T00:00:00.00Z","description":"Scroll becomes Stage 1 by improving permissions and introducing enforced batch mode.","type":"general"},{"title":"SCR token launch","url":"https://scroll.io/blog/scr-token","date":"2024-10-19T00:00:00.00Z","description":"Scroll launches its SCR token.","type":"general"},{"title":"Batches reverted","url":"https://status.scroll.io/incidents/44k6s4qg6kcs","date":"2024-07-05T00:00:00Z","description":"To fix a bug in the compression, 55 previously committed batches are reverted.","type":"incident"},{"title":"Darwin upgrade","url":"https://scroll.io/blog/proof-recursion-scrolls-darwin-upgrade","date":"2024-08-21T00:00:00.00Z","description":"Introduces a reduction in gas fees through bundling multiple batches into a single validity proof.","type":"general"},{"title":"Curie upgrade","url":"https://scroll.io/blog/compressing-the-gas-scrolls-curie-upgrade","date":"2024-07-03T00:00:00.00Z","description":"Introduces data compression, new opcodes, dynamic block time, and new transaction types.","type":"general"},{"title":"Bernoulli upgrade","url":"https://scroll.io/blog/blobs-are-here-scrolls-bernoulli-upgrade","date":"2024-04-29T00:00:00.00Z","description":"Introduces EIP-4844 data blobs for L1 data availability, and the SHA2-256 precompile on L2.","type":"general"},{"title":"Scroll official launch","url":"https://x.com/Scroll_ZKP/status/1714286874020528554","date":"2023-10-17T00:00:00.00Z","description":"Scroll announces its official launch.","type":"general"},{"title":"Scroll Alpha testnet launch","url":"https://scroll.io/blog/alphaTestnet","date":"2023-02-27T00:00:00.00Z","description":"Scroll launches its Alpha testnet on Goerli.","type":"general"}],"discoveryInfo":{"isDiscoDriven":false,"permissionsDiscoDriven":false,"contractsDiscoDriven":false,"timestampPerChain":{"ethereum":1755858338,"scroll":1755858338},"hasDiscoUi":false}}
