This architecture comprises the following components:\n\n- **Availability Gateway**: The primary interface provided by the operator for committee members to access new batch information and submit signed availability claims.\n- **Data Availability Committee (DAC)**: A group of nodes responsible for storing state data associated with each Merkle root and attesting to data availability by signing claims.\n- **Data Batches**: Collections of transactions processed in batches that update the state of accounts, resulting in a new Merkle root representing the updated state.\n\nCommittee members run services that interact with the Availability Gateway to obtain information about new batches and submit their signed availability claims. Each batch includes a unique batch_id, a reference to a previous batch, and a list of account updates. \nCommittee members combine this information with data from the reference batch to compute the new state and verify the Merkle root.\n\nWhen the operator produces a new batch, it must be signed by a minimum number of committee members—as defined by the application's configuration—for it to be accepted onchain. \nThis includes all members designated as mandatory signers. If the operator attempts to submit a batch without the required signatures, it will be rejected, thereby ensuring that data remains available and consistent.\n\nCommittee members are expected to maintain a database that stores the data associated with each batch, making use of storage solutions with a replication factor of at least 2.\n\n## DA Bridge Architecture\n![starkex bridge architecture](/images/da-bridge-technology/starkex/architectureL2.png#center)\n\nThe DA commitments are posted to the destination chain, using the Committee Verifier contract as a DA bridge.\nThe DA commitment consists of a data hash of the transaction batch the Committee has signed off on and a concatenation of ec-signatures by signatories.\n\nThe Committee Verifier contract verifies the signatures and the data hash and if the required threshold of Committee members has signed off on the data, the hash is stored as a registeredFact in the StarkEx contract.\nIn a separate transaction, the operator calls the updateState() function on the StarkEx contract to update the state.\nBefore the state update is accepted, the StarkEx contract verifies the transaction public inputs by calling the isValid() function, which verifies the hash derived from state update inputs matches the hash stored by the Committee Verifier contract.\n","risks":[{"category":"Funds can be lost if","text":"a malicious committee signs a data availability attestation for an unavailable transaction batch."}],"references":[{"title":"StarkEx Committee Service - Source Code","url":"https://github.com/starkware-libs/starkex-data-availability-committee"}]},"risks":{"committeeSecurity":{"value":"2/4","sentiment":"bad","description":"The committee does not meet basic security standards, either due to insufficient size, lack of member diversity, or poorly defined threshold parameters.
