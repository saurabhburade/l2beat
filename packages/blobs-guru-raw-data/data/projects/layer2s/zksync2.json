During these first two periods, the proposal can be canceled by the proposer or if it falls below the proposing threshold.\nA proposal is only successful if it reaches both quorum (630M ZK tokens) and simple majority. When it reaches quorum, a remaining voting period of 3d is guaranteed by a potential late quorum vote extension.\nIn the successful case, it can be queued in the 0s timelock which forwards it via the Gateway to Ethereum as an L2->L1 log.\n### On Ethereum\nAfter the execution of the proposal-containing batch (3h delay), the proposal is now picked up by the ProtocolUpgradeHandler and enters the 3d 'legal veto period'.\nThis serves as a window in which a veto could be coordinated offchain, to be then enforced by non-approval of Guardians and SecurityCouncil. A threshold of 2 Guardians can extend the veto period to 7d.\nAfter this a proposal enters a *waiting* state of 1mo, from which it can be immediately approved (cancelling the delay) by 6 participants of the SecurityCouncil.\nFor the unlikely case that the Security Council does not approve here, the Guardians can instead approve the proposal, or nobody. In the two latter cases, the waiting period is enforced in full.\nA proposal cannot be actively cancelled in the ProtocolUpgradeHandler, but will expire if not approved within the waiting period. An approved proposal now enters the *pendingExecution* state for a final delay of 1d and can then be executed.\n### Other governance tracks\nThere are two other tracks of Governance also starting with DAO Delegate proposals the ZKsync Era rollup: 1) Token Program Proposals that add new minters, allocations or upgrade the ZK token and\n2) Governance Advisory Proposals that e.g. change the ZK Credo or other offchain Governance Procedures without onchain targets.\nThe protocol for these two other tracks is similar to the first part of the standard path described above (albeit having different quorum and timelock values), and not passing over to the Ethereum L1.\nFurther customizations are that the ZkFoundationMultisig can propose to the ZkTokenGovernor without a threshold and that the Guardians' L2 alias can cancel proposals in the ZkTokenGovernor and the ZkGovOpsGovernor.\n## Emergency path\nSecurityCouncil (9/12), Guardians (5/8) and ZkFoundationMultisig (3/5) form a de-facto 3/3 Multisig\nby pushing an immediate upgrade proposal through the EmergencyUpgradeBoard, which circumvents all delays and executes immediately via the ProtocolUpgradeHandler.\n## Upgrade Delays\nThe cumulative duration of the upgrade paths from the moment of a voted 'successful' proposal is 4d 3h or 8d 3h (depending on Guardians extending the LegalVetoPeriod) for Standard, 0 for Emergency and 1mo 4d for the path in which the SecurityCouncil is not approving the proposal.\n## Freezing\nThe SecurityCouncil can freeze (pause withdrawals and settlement) all chains connected to the current ChainTypeManager.\nEither for a softFreeze of 12h or a hardFreeze of 7d.\nAfter a softFreeze and / or a hardFreeze, a proposal from the EmergencyUpgradeBoard has to be passed before subsequent freezes are possible.\nOnly the SecurityCouncil can unfreeze an active freeze.\n## ZK cluster Admin and Chain Admin\nApart from the paths that can upgrade all shared implementations, the ZK stack governance system defines other roles that can modify the system:\nA single *ZK cluster Admin* role who governs parameters in the shared contracts and a *Chain Admin* role (defined in each chain-specific diamond contract) for managing parameters of each individual ZK chain that builds on the stack.\nThese chain-specific actions include critical operations like setting a transaction filterer that can censor L1 -> L2 messages, changing the DA mode, migrating the chain to a different settlement layer and standard operations like setting fee parameters and adding / removing Validators in the ValidatorTimelock.\nFor rollups, data availability on Ethereum is validated by a RollupL1DAValidator contract (or a RelayedSLDAValidator on the Gateway). Each rollup can become a permanent rollup (through their Chain Admin) which disallows DA changes to non-whitelisted sources or settlement layers in the future.\nThe source of truth for rollup-compliant DA validator contracts is the RollupDAManager contract, which is administered via the ProtocolUpgradeHandler.\nZKsync Era's Chain Admin differs from the others as it also has the above *ZK cluster Admin* role in the shared ZK stack contracts.","permissions":{"gateway":{"roles":[{"id":"Validator","name":"Validator","description":"Permissioned to call the functions to commit, prove, execute and revert L2 batches through the ValidatorTimelock in the main Diamond contract.","accounts":[{"address":"gateway:0xcA027Fa98cdce4515E76ECf8dfb4189B16eE72A2","type":"Contract","isVerified":true,"name":"PartialValidatorTimelock","url":"#PartialValidatorTimelock"},{"address":"gateway:0x30066439887C0a509Cb38E45c9262E6924a29BbD","type":"EOA","isVerified":true,"name":"EOA 1","url":"#EOA-1"}],"chain":"gateway","discoveryDrivenData":true}],"actors":[{"id":"ZKsyncValidatorTimelock","name":"ZKsyncValidatorTimelock","accounts":[{"address":"gateway:0xb83fdD24F40cb2AA5CC9c2A2A0c06E50fA9B4CEa","type":"Contract","isVerified":true,"name":"0xb83f…4CEa","url":"https://gateway.explorer.zksync.io/address/0xb83fdD24F40cb2AA5CC9c2A2A0c06E50fA9B4CEa"}],"chain":"gateway","description":"Intermediary contract between the *Validators* and the central diamond contract that delays block execution (ie withdrawals and other L2 --> L1 messages) by 0s.\n* Can interact with DiamondProxy\n  * commit, prove, execute, revert batches directly in the main Diamond contract.
