OptimismMintableERC20 is a standard extension of the base ERC20 token contract designed to allow the L1StandardBridge contracts to mint and burn tokens. This makes it possible to use an OptimismMintableERC20 as this chain's representation of a token on the host chain, or vice-versa.\n* Roles:\n  * **admin**: ProxyAdmin; ultimately Conduit Multisig 1","upgradableBy":[{"name":"Conduit Multisig 1","delay":"no"}],"discoveryDrivenData":true},{"name":"ProxyAdmin","isVerified":true,"address":"eth:0xb4899FF43Ae727B1E9CB19AC44660e4A43Fad0b5","upgradeability":{"proxyType":"immutable","admins":[],"implementations":[],"immutable":true},"chain":"ethereum","description":"* Roles:\n  * **owner**: Conduit Multisig 1","discoveryDrivenData":true},{"name":"ProxyAdmin","isVerified":true,"address":"eth:0xb570F4aD27e7De879A2E4F2F3DE27dBaBc20E9B9","upgradeability":{"proxyType":"immutable","admins":[],"implementations":[],"immutable":true},"chain":"ethereum","description":"* Roles:\n  * **owner**: Conduit Multisig 1","discoveryDrivenData":true},{"name":"PermissionedDisputeGame","isVerified":true,"address":"eth:0xef91b38Ca24C97C7147FcA3429503c76CdE043DD","upgradeability":{"proxyType":"immutable","admins":[],"implementations":[],"immutable":true},"chain":"ethereum","description":"Same as FaultDisputeGame, but only two permissioned addresses are designated as proposer and challenger.\n* Roles:\n  * **challenger**: Conduit Multisig 1\n  * **proposer**: EOA 2","discoveryDrivenData":true},{"name":"MIPS","isVerified":true,"address":"eth:0xF027F4A985560fb13324e943edf55ad6F1d15Dc1","upgradeability":{"proxyType":"immutable","admins":[],"implementations":[],"immutable":true},"chain":"ethereum","description":"The MIPS contract is used to execute the final step of the dispute game which objectively determines the winner of the dispute.\n","discoveryDrivenData":true},{"name":"DelayedWETH","isVerified":true,"address":"eth:0xFc908935E4BBA7D7bD1CBFf72bDD79bd1c1d751E","upgradeability":{"proxyType":"EIP1967 proxy","admins":["eth:0xb570F4aD27e7De879A2E4F2F3DE27dBaBc20E9B9"],"implementations":["eth:0x5e40B9231B86984b5150507046e354dbFbeD3d9e"]},"chain":"ethereum","description":"Contract designed to hold the bonded ETH for each game.

Each bisection move requires a stake that increases expontentially with the depth of the bisection, with a factor of 1.09493. The maximum depth is 73, and reaching it therefore requires a cumulative stake of 0.00 ETH from depth 0. Actors can participate in any challenge by calling the `defend` or `attack` functions, depending whether they agree or disagree with the latest claim and want to move the bisection game forward. Actors that disagree with the top-level claim are called challengers, and actors that agree are called defenders. Each actor might be involved in multiple (sub-)challenges at the same time, meaning that the protocol operates with [full concurrency](https://medium.com/l2beat/fraud-proof-wars-b0cb4d0f452a). Challengers and defenders alternate in the bisection game, and they pass each other a clock that starts with 3d 12h. If a clock expires, the claim is considered defeated if it was countered, or it gets confirmed if uncountered. Since honest parties can inherit clocks from malicious parties that play both as challengers and defenders (see [freeloader claims](https://specs.optimism.io/fault-proof/stage-one/fault-dispute-game.html#freeloader-claims)), if a clock gets inherited with less than 3h, it generally gets extended by 3h with the exception of 6h right before depth 30, and 1d right before the last depth. The maximum clock extension that a top level claim can get is therefore 10d. Since unconfirmed state roots are independent of one another, users can decide to exit with a subsequent confirmed state root if the previous one is delayed. Winners get the entire losers' stake, meaning that sybils can potentially play against each other at no cost. The final instruction found via the bisection game is then executed onchain in the MIPS one step prover contract who determines the winner. The protocol does not enforce valid bisections, meaning that actors can propose correct initial claims and then provide incorrect midpoints. The protocol can be subject to resource exhaustion attacks ([Spearbit 5.1.3](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/docs/security-reviews/2024_08_Fault-Proofs-No-MIPS_Spearbit.pdf)).","references":[{"title":"Fraud Proof Wars: OPFP","url":"https://medium.com/l2beat/fraud-proof-wars-b0cb4d0f452a"}]}]},"riskView":{"stateValidation":{"value":"Fraud proofs (INT)","description":"Fraud proofs allow actors watching the chain to prove that the state is incorrect.
