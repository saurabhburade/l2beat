The former Multisig also governs most other bridge escrows with instant upgradeability. The shared SHARP verifier used for state validation can be changed by the 2/4 SHARP Multisig with and a 8d delay, affecting all rollups like Starknet that are sharing it. \n\nThe Operator role in the Starknet contract is permissioned to update the state of the Starknet rollup by supplying valid (zk) state transition proofs. Since this role is not permissionless, Starknet implements a StarknetSCMinorityMultisig with the Operator role, which allows a 3/12 minority of the StarknetSecurityCouncil to enforce censorship resistance by including transactions that are not included by regular Operators.\n\nAll bridge escrows allow enabling a withdrawal throttle of 5% of the locked funds per 24h period.
