OptimismMintableERC20 is a standard extension of the base ERC20 token contract designed to allow the L1StandardBridge contracts to mint and burn tokens. This makes it possible to use an OptimismMintableERC20 as this chain's representation of a token on the host chain, or vice-versa.\n* Roles:\n  * **admin**: ProxyAdmin; ultimately GnosisSafe","upgradableBy":[{"name":"GnosisSafe","delay":"no"}],"discoveryDrivenData":true},{"name":"ProxyAdmin","isVerified":true,"address":"eth:0xbE81A9D662422f667F634f3Fc301e2E360FeFB30","upgradeability":{"proxyType":"immutable","admins":[],"implementations":[],"immutable":true},"chain":"ethereum","description":"* Roles:\n  * **owner**: GnosisSafe","discoveryDrivenData":true}]},"risks":[{"category":"Funds can be stolen if","text":"a contract receives a malicious code upgrade.
