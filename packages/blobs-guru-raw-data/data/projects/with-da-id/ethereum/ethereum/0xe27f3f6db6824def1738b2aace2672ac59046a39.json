A valid state transition in Kinto disallows all transactions by EOAs and new contracts creation, unless specifically whitelisted.\nThis setup effectively enforces smart wallet use because the auxiliary contracts of the standard KintoWallet smart wallet (like the EntryPoint and the KintoWalletFactory) are whitelisted.\nThe KYC validation is part of the KintoWallet signature verification. Since all users must use the same implementation of this smart wallet, all user transactions on Kinto check for an up-to-date KYC flag, and are dropped in case the check fails.\nThe system ensures that KYC can be revoked only if the Security Council proactively agrees to a proposed status change by a KYC provider. The Security Council has been historically following KYC provider decisions and it is explicitly tasked to do so.\n\nThe KintoWallet implementation supports different signer thresholds with a maximum of 4 signers. The first signer for each users smart wallet though is enforced to be held by Turnkey in a TEE.\nUsers can make transactions using this first signer only through Kinto's frontend. Authenticated by a passkey, the Turnkey TEE then signs the transaction for them and submits it to the L2.\nThe user can still choose to not trust Turnkey by adding 2 EOA signers to their wallet and setting their signer policy to 2/3 during wallet creation.\n\nContracts outside of the ones necessary to interact with the smart wallet and to withdraw the gas token are out of scope for the stage assessment and might present additional risks."}},"config":{"associatedTokens":["K"],"escrows":[{"address":"0x859a53Fe2C8DA961387030E7CB498D6D20d0B2DB","sinceTimestamp":1702607855,"tokens":["ETH"],"contract":{"isVerified":true,"address":"eth:0x859a53Fe2C8DA961387030E7CB498D6D20d0B2DB","upgradeability":{"proxyType":"EIP1967 proxy","admins":["eth:0x74C717C01425eb475A5fC55d2A4a9045fC9800df"],"implementations":["eth:0x1c6ACCd9d66f3B993928E7439c9A2d67b94a445F"]},"chain":"ethereum","pastUpgrades":[{"timestamp":1702607855,"transactionHash":"0xd51bb4d6150d5fbaa61cf5281598b18c4efba4284aecb4420fc8d834dba357d8","implementations":["eth:0x1c6ACCd9d66f3B993928E7439c9A2d67b94a445F"]}],"description":"Contract managing Inboxes and Outboxes.

A state root can have multiple conflicting children. This structure forms a graph, and therefore, in the contracts, state roots are referred to as nodes.

New nodes cannot be created faster than the minimum assertion period by the same validator, currently set to 15m.

Validators cannot be in more than one challenge at the same time, meaning that the protocol operates with [partial concurrency](https://medium.com/l2beat/fraud-proof-wars-b0cb4d0f452a). Since each challenge lasts 6d 8h, this implies that the protocol can be subject to [delay attacks](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/solutions-to-delay-attacks-on-rollups-434f9d05a07a), where a malicious actor can delay withdrawals as long as they are willing to pay the cost of losing their stakes. If the protocol is delayed attacked, the new stake requirement increases exponentially for each challenge period of delay. Challenges are played via a bisection game, where asserter and challenger play together to find the first instruction of disagreement. Such instruction is then executed onchain in the WASM OneStepProver contract to determine the winner, who then gets half of the stake of the loser. As said before, a state root is rejected only when no one left is staked on it. The protocol does not enforces valid bisections, meaning that actors can propose correct initial claim and then provide incorrect midpoints.","references":[{"title":"Fraud Proof Wars: Arbitrum Classic","url":"https://medium.com/l2beat/fraud-proof-wars-b0cb4d0f452a"}]}]},"milestones":[{"title":"Appchain Stage 1","url":"https://medium.com/mamori-finance/kinto-is-now-a-stage1-appchain-2cf3c81546ea","date":"2025-03-27T00:00:00Z","description":"Users can exit the L2 in case of unwanted upgrades by actors other than the Security Council.","type":"general"},{"title":"Security Council Governance","url":"https://docs.kinto.xyz/kinto-the-safe-l2/security-kyc-aml/security-council","date":"2024-11-03T00:00:00Z","description":"Kinto gives the ownership of all L1 system contracts to a Security Council that is properly set up.","type":"general"},{"title":"First ever Challenge on mainnet","url":"https://x.com/vincfurc/status/1853891918037463521","date":"2024-10-31T00:00:00Z","description":"The first correctly resolved fault proof challenge of a mainnet Orbit stack rollup.","type":"general"},{"title":"Mainnet full launch","url":"https://medium.com/mamori-finance/%EF%B8%8F-engen-is-over-kinto-is-launching-d9f2dd49fb2e","date":"2024-05-22T00:00:00Z","description":"Engen mining is completed and locked funds are bridged to the Kinto L2.","type":"general"},{"title":"Kinto Mainnet Genesis","url":"https://medium.com/mamori-finance/%EF%B8%8F-kintos-launch-the-set-up-7eddfbb4bc38","date":"2023-12-15T00:00:00Z","description":"Kinto mainnet is launched.

This permission is held by the 6/8 Kinto Security Council on Layer 1 and can be executed without any delay.\nOn the Kinto Layer 2, critical permissions are mostly guarded by an AccessManager contract, and then passed down with configurable delays to both the Security Council and the 2/4 Kinto Multisig 2.\n\nThe Appchain designation of Kinto is mainly due to a modified L2 node, which queries a special censoring contract on L2 (called KintoAppRegistry) for a whitelist to filter transactions.\nThis makes the KintoAppRegistry contract a critical system contract and any change to its configuration equivalent to an upgrade of the Layer 2 system.\nThe KintoAppRegistry contract is also governed via the AccessManager by the Security Council or the Kinto Multisig 2 with a 12d delay.\n\nAnother critical contract on the Appchain is called KintoID. Permissioned actors with the 'KYC provider' role in the KintoID contract can 'sanction' (freeze) user smart wallets, preventing them from transacting.\nTo protect users from this role which is mostly held by EOAs, a sanction expires if not confirmed by the Security Council within 3d.\nAn expired sanction guarantees the user a 9d cooldown window during which they cannot be sanctioned again.\n\nThe canonical (enforced) smartwallet for users on Kinto can be upgraded via the KintoWalletFactory, using the same path via the AccessManager.\nAdditionally, each smart wallet must use a recoverer address custodied by Turnkey. This allows users to reset the wallet signers via their email in case they lose their passkey.\nIt also necessitates a recovery delay to prevent turnkey from maliciously using their recoverer permission. During this period of 12d, the user can cancel the recovery process with any transaction in their smart wallet.\n\nThe permissioned sanctions logic by KYC providers necessitates at least an 12d delay on all upgrades that aren't executed by the Security Council, allowing the user at least 7d to exit."}
